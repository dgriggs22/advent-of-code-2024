Advent of Code 2024

I am using Advent of Code to practice my coding skills. Please refer to https://adventofcode.com/2024/ for full descriptions or to try for yourself. 

The basic premise is that there are two problems per day of the month of December to keep Christmas running. A fun way to keep my skills in check while 
I work as a Systems engineer on a software team.

My goal is to complete the problems using Java or Python, but eventually I would like to attempt to solve these problems in multiple languages in order to
progress my skills.
